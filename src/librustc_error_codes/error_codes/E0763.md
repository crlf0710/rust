A lint that can only be specified at crate level was specified for other nodes.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0763
#[forbid(uncommon_codepoints)]
fn foo() {} // error!
```

To fix this error, move it to the root of the crate as an inner attribute:

```
#![forbid(uncommon_codepoints)]

fn foo() {}
```
